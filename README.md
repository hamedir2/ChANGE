Alanine_Scan.py: this file designs guide RNAs and homology arms needed to change all the amino acids in the gene of interest to Alanine. In this example, BUL1 gene was chosen and Alanine Scanned.

Saturated_Mutagenesis.py: this file designs guide RNAs and homology arms needed to change all the amino acids in a region of interest in a gene to all the possible amino acids. In this example, UBC4 gene was chosen and Alanine Scanned.
